# HrDataApi
This API houses Hr Data for a mock company.  Its offices endpoint takes a poorly formatted csv of office locations and serves it up in usable JSON paired with geo-location coordinates.

To utilize this Api on your local machine, you will need to create an account with PositionStack, which can be done here:
 - https://positionstack.com/quickstart

Once signed up, the aquired API key must go in the local-config file.
